* Object-Oriented Programming
** class, attribute, field, variable, object, instance...
From [[http://python.swaroopch.com/][A Byte of Python]] chapter 13.

A /class/ creates a new /type/.
An /object/ is the /instance/ of a /class/.

A /class/ has two *attributes* which are *field* and *method*.
Variables that belong to /object/ or /class/ are referred as
*instance variables* or *class variables* respectively, they
consist of *field*. *Method* is the functions belong to the 
/class/.
