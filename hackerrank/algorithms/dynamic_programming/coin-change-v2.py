The Coin Change Problem
https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/coin-change

Given a value N, if we want to make change for N cents, and we have infinite
supply of each of C = {C1, C2, ..., CM} valued coins, how many ways can we make
the change? The order of coins doesnâ€™t matter.

clue:

1. sorted tuples in set. {(,), (,),...} can eliminate overlappings.
2. save results in dict can improve performance.
3. only require the number of ways but not showing all the ways.
4. since clue-3, clue-1 is changed, only save the length of that set.

another clue:

1. there is a way to build a list level by level that no overlappings will exist.
2. example for coin types [1, 2, 3]
   1                                2            3
   1              2        3        2       3    3
   1      2    3  2    3   3        2    3  3    3
   1 2 3  2 3  3  2 3  3   3        2 3  3  3    3
3. see coin-change-v2.py(this file) for details

This is the best method and so-called 'dynamical programming'.
see coin-change-v3.py for details.
