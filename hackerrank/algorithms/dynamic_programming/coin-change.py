The Coin Change Problem
https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/coin-change

Given a value N, if we want to make change for N cents, and we have infinite
supply of each of C = {C1, C2, ..., CM} valued coins, how many ways can we make
the change? The order of coins doesnâ€™t matter.

clue:

1. sorted tuples in set. {(,), (,),...} can eliminate overlappings.
2. save results in dict can improve performance.
